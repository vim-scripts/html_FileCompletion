DESCRIPTION
This plugin offers insert mode file completion for HTML links to local files,
taking into account a base directory (document root) and base URL (web server
location) to enable completion of absolute (/foo...) and fully qualified
(http://host/foo...) links.

USAGE
CTRL-X CTRL-F           Find matches for file names that start with the same
                        'isfname' characters as before the cursor. File names
                        are inserted in URL-escaped form (e.g. <Space> -> %20)
                        and always with forward slashes as path separator.
                        An absolute file path starting with "/" is interpreted
                        relative to b:basedir, and a base URL b:baseurl is
                        stripped off the front. This enables you to complete
                        file links even though they are specified as absolute
                        or fully qualified links in the HTML.
