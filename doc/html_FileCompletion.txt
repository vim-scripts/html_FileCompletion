DESCRIPTION				     *html_FileCompletion-description*

This plugin offers insert mode file completion for HTML links to local files,
taking into account a base directory (document root) and base URL (web server
location) to enable completion of absolute (/foo...) and fully qualified
(http://host/foo...) links.

==============================================================================
USAGE						   *html_FileCompletion-usage*

CTRL-X CTRL-F		Find matches for file names that start with the same
			'isfname' characters as before the cursor. File names
			are inserted in URL-escaped form (e.g. <Space> -> %20)
			and always with forward slashes as path separator.
			An absolute file path starting with "/" is interpreted
			relative to |b:basedir|, and a base URL |b:baseurl| is
			stripped off the front. This enables you to complete
			file links even though they are specified as absolute
			or fully qualified links in the HTML.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				    *html_FileCompletion-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim html_FileCompletion.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				    *html_FileCompletion-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				   *html_FileCompletion-configuration*

Set the following variables in autocmds, filetype plugins or a local vimrc:
								   *b:basedir*
Specifies the local directory that represents the document root of the edited
HTML file, i.e. where an absolute link starting with "/" points to. To make
this resistant to changes in the CWD, this should be an absolute dirspec. In a
local vimrc located at the document root, you could use: >
    let b:basedir = expand('<sfile>:p:h')
<								   *b:baseurl*
Specifies the server location of the |b:basedir| document root; i.e. a fully
qualified link to the document root, including protocol and hostname.


For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
				     *g:html_FileCompletion_WithinDocRootGlob*
The |b:basedir| can be auto-discovered when it isn't set. Starting with the
directory the current file is in, it will traverse the directory hierarchy
upward until it finds a directory that does _not_ contain typical HTML files,
and will then take the previous directory as the document root. You can adapt
the file glob of what represents files within the document root via: >
    let g:html_FileCompletion_WithinDocRootGlob = '*.{htm,html,xhtml,asp,gsp,jsp,php}'
<
